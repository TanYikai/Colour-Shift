Game: Colour Shift
By Non-Static

Synopsis
Reach the white door. You can extract colours out of 'keys' and enemies where they can be used as ammunition to shoot enemies or colour your suit
You can only pass by gates of the same colour of your suit and can only kill enemies by turning them white.
This can be done by painting them with complementary colours.
You have 3 lives. When you receive damage, you turn invulnerable for 1 second.

White cannot be merged with anything.
Primary colours can be merged with other primary colours except itself to obtain a secondary colour or the complementary secondary colour to obtain white.
Secondary colours can be mixed with other secondary colours or the complementary primary colour to obtain white.
Merging will combine your top two blocks in your stack.
